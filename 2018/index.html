				<p>This is your chance to enroll in McDonald’s health benefits for 2019. After enrollment ends you can’t change your mind or drop coverage unless you have a qualified life event like marriage or birth of a child.</p>
				<p class="crew">Once you sign up, you are responsible for making premium payments all year. If you do not make your premium payments (for example, if your hours are reduced during the year and your paycheck is not enough to cover your premium), your coverage will be cancelled for the rest of the year.</p>
				<p>Use this guide to learn about your choices. Simply click on the tabs above. </p>
				<p>Then take action! The chart below shows what happens if you do nothing.	</p>
