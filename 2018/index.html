				<p>Annual Enrollment is your opportunity to enroll in McDonald’s health benefits, and/or make changes to your existing plans for 2019. After the Annual Enrollment period ends, you won’t be able to make changes or drop your coverage unless you have a qualified life event like a marriage or birth of a child.</p>
				<p class="crew">Once you sign up, you will be required to make premium payments. If you don't make your premium payments, your coverage will be cancelled.</p>
				<p>We’ve put together this guide to help you learn about and navigate your choices. Simply click on the tabs above.  </p>
				<p>If you take no action during Annual Enrollment, the chart below shows what happens 	</p>

				<div class="table-responsive">
						<table class="table table-striped">

									<th>If you currently…</th>
									<th>Then you will…</th>
								</tr>

							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>Have McDonald’s medical, dental and/or vision coverage</td>
									<td>Remain in your current plans for 2019, including the same surcharges and dependent coverage<ul><li><strong>Because there are some changes to the plans in 2019 – including costs – it’s important that you consider at all your options</strong></li>
