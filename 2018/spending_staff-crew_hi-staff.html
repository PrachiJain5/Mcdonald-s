				<!-- <p class="lead part-time">You are eligible for part-time benefits.</p> -->
				<p><b>Spending accounts let you set aside money from your paycheck to use for health and/or dependent care expenses that you normally pay out of pocket. This helps you budget, plus the money is taken from your paycheck before taxes are taken out, so you pay less in taxes!</b> </p>
                <p>McDonald’s offers a Healthcare Flexible Spending Account and a Dependent Care Spending Account. You can be reimbursed for eligible expenses from both accounts that are incurred up until March 15, 2020. You must submit documentation for the eligible expenses by May 31, 2020.</p>

                                    <p>No. McDonald’s does not offer an HSA at this time. Three of the most important differences include: 
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The money in an HSA rolls over from year to year and is yours to keep when you retire or leave the company. You lose any money left in your Healthcare Flexible Spending Account at the end of the period or when you leave McDonald’s.</li>
                                            <li>There are higher contribution limits for an HSA.</li>
                                            <li>Changes can be made to the amount being contributed to an HSA throughout the year. You cannot change your contribution amount to your Healthcare Flexible Spending Account unless you have certain life events.</li>
