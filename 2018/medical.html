                              <p>Under all three medical plans:
                                  <ol>
                                      <li>You pay a <b>premium </b>to have coverage. This is the amount that comes out of your paycheck.</li>
                                      <li>You pay nothing for covered in-network preventive care, like your annual physical and related lab work. </li>
                                      <li>McDonald’s puts money into your <b>Health Reimbursement Account (HRA).</b> Your HRA automatically pays for your eligible non-preventive medical expenses – like doctor’s visits or medical procedures until it runs out. In this way, it helps you pay your annual deductible.</li>
                                      <li>After you spend your HRA dollars, you pay the full cost of your health care until you reach your <b>annual deductible.</b></li>
                                      <li>After reaching the deductible, you and McDonald’s share the cost of your medical expenses through <b>coinsurance.</b></li>
                                      <li>If you reach your <b>out-of-pocket maximum,</b> then McDonald’s pays 100% of eligible medical expenses for the rest of the year. So, the out-of-pocket maximum is the most you’ll pay in coinsurance and deductibles for medical care, mental health/substance abuse services and prescriptions combined before the plan pays 100%.*</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <small>*There are some costs that do not count towards your out-of-pocket maximum. These include: Ineligible charges; amounts over reasonable and customary fees; $5 copays for prescriptions from an out-of-network pharmacy; the $25 penalty for a maintenance prescription at a retail pharmacy after three 30-day fills; and amounts you pay for brand-name drugs when a generic is available. </small>

                                  <p>An HRA is free money from McDonald’s to help you pay for your health care costs. No matter what medical plan you select, McDonald’s puts money in your HRA. How much you get depends on which medical plan you choose.</p>
                                  <p>Your HRA is can only be used for medical costs. It does not cover preventive, dental or vision expenses. It can also cover Virtual Visits copays – if funds are available.</p>
                                  <p>Here are some important things to understand about the money in your HRA:
                                      <ol>
                                          <li>If you are in a McDonald’s plan in 2018 and have money left in your HRA at the end of the year, you can keep it to use in 2019, as long as you participate in a McDonald’s plan again. The most you can rollover into the next year’s HRA is $500 for employee-only coverage and $1,000 for all other coverage levels. You will still receive the 2019 contribution from McDonald’s. </li>
                                          <li>You only use your HRA dollars while you work at McDonald’s. You can’t take HRA dollars with you if you leave the company.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                      <p>We know there are many things to consider, so ask yourself some of the following questions to help narrow down your choices.
                                          <ol>
                                              <li>Do you prefer to pay more out of your paycheck (premiums) and less when you get medical care or the other way around? </li>

                                                    <li>The Gold plan premiums are quite a bit higher, but the plan covers more of the cost when you need medical care and begins sharing the cost of your care sooner.</li>
                                                    <li>The Bronze plan premiums are the lowest, but you will pay more of your medical care costs.</li>
                                                    <li>The Silver plan is in the middle.</li>

                                              <li>Are you and your family generally healthy, often just getting preventive care during the year?  </li>

                                                  <li>Consider the Gold and Silver plans since you know you will have significant medical expenses.</li>
                                              </ul>
                                              <li>Do you or a family member take prescription drugs regularly?</li>
                                              <ul>
                                                  <li>The Gold plan pays a higher percentage of the cost of medications.</li>
