				<h4>Team Members</h4>
				<p>Your eligibility for benefits is based on your position, average hours and time with Target. You can view the benefits you are eligible for during the enrollment process.</p>
				<p>If you are an hourly team member, your benefits eligibility is reviewed each year before the beginning of the plan year. Based on this annual review, your benefits eligibility could change for the next plan year. <span class="hawaii">If you become ineligible, you can regain eligibility at any point throughout the year by working 20-plus hours for four consecutive weeks.</span> Average hours are calculated using the previous 12 months. To view your average hours throughout the year, access your pay statement.</p>

				<h4>Dependents</h4>
				<p>Enrolling ONLY eligible dependents keeps costs down for all of us. Eligible dependents to cover under Target supplemental medical and/or dental plans include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Legal spouses.</strong> If you are legally divorced, your ex-spouse is not eligible but may be able to elect COBRA. COBRA stands for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. It gives employees the right to pay premiums for and keep the group health insurance that they would otherwise lose.</li>
					<li><strong>Domestic partners.</strong> You and your domestic partner must certify your committed relationship at the time of enrollment.</li>
					<li><strong>Dependent children until age 26.</strong> This includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Biological children, legally adopted children, children placed with you in anticipation of adoption, stepchildren, foster children and children of your domestic partner.</li>
							<li>Grandchildren who are unmarried, live with you and depend on you for principal support, and are the child(ren) of your unmarried covered dependent child.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Disabled dependents.</strong> These dependents are age 26 or older, depend on you for principal support, and are approved for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>To enroll an eligible dependent</strong>, you will be asked to provide his or her Social Security number. If you enroll dependents who are not eligible, Target has the right to remove coverage and may take disciplinary action against you, up to and including termination.</p>
				<div class="full-time hawaii">
					<p><strong>To verify a marriage or domestic partnership</strong>, you will need to provide two documents that confirm:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The start of a marriage or domestic partnership, such as a marriage certificate or domestic partnership affidavit, <strong>and</strong></li>
						<li>That the relationship is still current by submitting documents that show joint status, such as a tax return, credit card statement, bank statement or lease agreement.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>To verify a child dependent</strong>, you will need to provide proof of the parent-child relationship, such as a birth or adoption certificate.</p>
					<p><strong>To verify a disabled dependent</strong>, you must provide proof that the child is disabled, and you must notify Target within 31 days after the disability or dependency ends.</p>
					<p>You'll find details about the dependent verification process on the <strong>Submitted Successfully</strong> page after you enroll.</p>
