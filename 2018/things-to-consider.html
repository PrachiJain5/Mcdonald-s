						<h3>Things to Consider If You're Raising Your Family</h3>
						<p>There's never a dull moment in your life. To help make reviewing your benefits easier, here are a few things to consider:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Prepare for accidents on the soccer field or in the dance studio</strong>
								<br>Accident insurance pays money directly to you to help pay for eligible expenses related to things like broken bones and sprains. The amount you receive is based on the services needed. You may want to consider Hospital Indemnity insurance too, in case the accident is serious enough to result in a hospital stay.

						<h3>Things to Consider If You're an Empty-Nester</h3>
						<p>Now that you're in a different stage of life, you may want to think about your benefits differently too.</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="full-time"><strong>Take another look at the HSA Plan</strong>
								<br>You probably already know that you will pay less out of your paycheck and more when you receive care for this plan. Did you know that your total costs – even if you need a lot of health care services – typically are lower in the HSA Plan? While enrolling, you'll have the opportunity to check it out yourself with a tool that helps you estimate your total costs.
								<br><a href="prepare-to-choose-2018-benefits.html#pills-medicalOne">Medical Plans</a>
							</li>
							<li class="full-time"><strong>After choosing the HSA Plan, save for future medical needs with an HSA</strong>
								<br>In the HSA Plan, you are eligible for a Health Savings Account. You own the account and can save the money for future medical expenses (even those in retirement)*. Plus, the account earns interest tax-free, and you can choose to invest your account dollars once your balance reaches $2,100. You can contribute up to $3,450 if you have Team Member Only coverage and $6,850 if you have another level of coverage. If you will be age 55 or older in 2018, you can contribute an additional $1,000.
								<br><a href="prepare-to-choose-2018-benefits.html#pills-fsa-hsa">HSA</a>
								<br>*Note: The IRS has restrictions on using Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA) dollars to cover non-tax dependents, such as adult children and domestic partners. Contact your tax advisor with questions.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Manage your current medical needs</strong>
								<br>Supplemental medical coverage helps you pay your medical and non-medical expenses (such as travel, pet care, and much more) when you are facing a serious illness or hospital stay. The payout comes directly to you so you can use the money to help yourself in whatever way you need.
								<br><a href="prepare-to-choose-2018-benefits.html#pills-supplemental">Accident, Hospital Indemnity and Critical Illness Insurance</a>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Save for the retirement of your dreams</strong>
								<br>It's getting closer! If you aren't already saving the maximum allowed by the IRS, consider increasing your contributions now (the maximum allowed is $18,500. If you will be 50 in 2018, you can increase your contributions an additional $6,000).
